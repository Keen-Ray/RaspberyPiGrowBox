# RaspberyPiGrowBox
This project is a the rest of a summer project with the raspberry pi. It was a smart plant box that measured temperature, and water content to determine if the box needed to be heated (with a light bulb), cooled (with computer fans), or watered. (with an electric valve) Also if something appeared to be wrong it would text me a warning.
